You are developing a time tracking application for a company. The employees log their time in minutes. The management wants to see these durations in hours for better understanding. Your task is to write a function that can convert minutes into hours.
 
**Function:**
 
public static double convertToHours(int minutes);
 
**Inputs:**
 
The function convertToHours(int minutes) will receive one parameter:
- minutes (1 ≤ minutes ≤ 10^6): an integer which represents the number of minutes to be converted.
 
**Outputs:**
 
The function will return a double - the equivalent number of hours.
**Example:**
 
**Sample Input:**
convertToHours(90);
 
**Sample Output:**
1.5
 
**Note:**
 
In the sample input, the number of minutes given to the function is 90. The equivalent in hours is 90/60=1.5, so the function returns 1.5 as the output. Your function should work accurately to provide correct information to the management.
 
Question: 15
  **Problem: Halve It**
 
You are helping a friend in developing a financial app. The app has a feature where it calculates half of the entered amount for splitting bills. Your task is to write a function that takes a number and returns its half.
 
**Function:**
 
public static double halveTheNumber(double num);
 
**Inputs:**
 
The function halveTheNumber(double num) will receive one parameter:
- num (0 ≤ num ≤ 10^9): a double which represents the amount entered by the user to be halved.
 
**Outputs:**
 
The function will return a double - the result of halving the num.  
**Example:**
 
**Sample Input:
halveTheNumber(150.00);
 
Sample Output:
75.00
 
Note:
In the sample input, the number given to the function is 150.00. The half of this number is 150.00/2=75.00, so the function returns 75.00 as the output. Make sure your function works correctly to split the bills accurately.
